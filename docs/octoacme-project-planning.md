# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by PM and Scrum Master)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Business Analyst translates requirements into user stories)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. UX Designer finalizes design specifications and component library
8. Technical Writer plans documentation structure and timeline

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
