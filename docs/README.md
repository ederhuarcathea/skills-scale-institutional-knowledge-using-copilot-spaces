# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management process documentation. This guide provides a comprehensive, customer-first approach to delivering product features, services, and integrations through iterative, data-informed practices.

## Purpose

The OctoAcme approach helps cross-functional teams deliver value efficiently through clear ownership, psychological safety, and measured outcomes. Teams follow structured phases while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on evidence and feedback.

## Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **UX Designer**: Create user-centered designs and conduct usability research
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitate agile ceremonies and remove team impediments
- **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**: Ensure system reliability, monitoring, and incident response
- **Technical Writer**: Create and maintain product documentation and release notes
- **Business Analyst**: Translate business requirements into actionable user stories
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and feedback

## Lifecycle

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, stakeholders, and high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Scope work, identify dependencies, create backlog with acceptance criteria
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate in short cycles
4. **Release**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and announce to stakeholders
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and identify actionable improvements

## Team Rhythm

- **Daily standups** (15 min): Progress updates, blockers, and dependencies
- **Weekly PM + PdM sync**: Alignment on priorities and risks
- **Sprint demos**: Showcase completed work at milestone boundaries
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Communicate progress and upcoming plans

## Key Artifacts

- **Project One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, success metrics, timeline
- **Prioritized Backlog**: Features with acceptance criteria and estimates
- **Release Notes**: Changes, migration steps, and known issues
- **Risk Register**: Identified risks with impact, likelihood, and mitigation plans
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items for continuous improvement
