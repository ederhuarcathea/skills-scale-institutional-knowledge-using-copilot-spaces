# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Facilitated by: Scrum Master (ensures psychological safety and balanced participation)
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Include cross-functional perspectives:
  - UX Designer shares user feedback and usability insights
  - SRE discusses operational and reliability learnings
  - Technical Writer reports on documentation gaps or improvements
  - Business Analyst validates if outcomes matched business expectations
